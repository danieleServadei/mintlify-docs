## Api Keys

<Warning>Your API key is a secret. Do not share it with anyone or expose it in your application.</Warning>

The API key is a unique identifier that allows you to authenticate with the AI Fraud Detector API. 
It is used to identify the organization that is making the request and to authorize access to the API.

With the API key you can [create new user](/api-reference/endpoint/create-user.mdx) and [insert new entities](/api-reference/endpoint/insert-product.mdx).


From the API keys page, you can create a new API key, list all the API keys associated with your organization, and delete an API key.

<Warning>You'll be able to see your full API key only right after it's created; for security reasons, at all other times, it will be displayed partially.</Warning>
