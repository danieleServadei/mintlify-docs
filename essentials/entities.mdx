## Entities

The entity is the foundation of the application and represents any item uploaded ready to be evaluated by AI. It has its fundamental characteristics, which are:

- ID (internal to the application)
- ID assigned by the organization
- Title
- Description
- Extra Info

Thanks to these characteristics, the application can process the product through interaction with AI, receiving in response the possibility or impossibility of fraud.

To be added, an entity must be sent through an [API call](/api-reference/endpoint/insert-product.mdx).

The validation of the product performed by AI can be confirmed or rejected by an Organization user or be [auto-validated](/essentials/auto-validation) (if this option is activated).
