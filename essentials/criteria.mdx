## What is a Criteria?

The criteria are the guidelines that AI will follow to evaluate your entity. Thanks to the customization of the criteria, you can describe what your organization defines as fraud.

Thanks to the criteria, it's possible to meet the needs and specifications that each organization may have.

## Manage Criteria

To manage the criteria, you need to access the organization settings page. From there, you can select the criteria you want to use.

For a security reason, the criteria can't be deleted or created, but you can enable or disable them.
If you need to create a new criteria, please contact us.

<Warning>It's important to have at least 3 criteria enabled to validate the entities. If you have less than 3 criteria enabled, the entities will not be validated.</Warning>
