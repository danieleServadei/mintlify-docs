## How Auto Validation Works

The auto-validation feature allows the AI Fraud Detector to automatically validate entities without the need for human intervention. This feature is useful when you have a high volume of entities to validate and you want to speed up the process.

When the auto-validation feature is enabled, the AI Fraud Detector will automatically validate the entities if the reliability percentage is above a certain threshold. The threshold is set in the organization settings page.

An auto-validated entity will have a validation status of `AUTO_VALIDATED` will be send to the webhook with the `AUTO_RESPONSE` type.

<Warning>It will validate only the new entities that are inserted into the system. The entities that are already validated or that are awaiting validation will not be auto-validated.</Warning>
<Info>It's possible that, to streamline the process, only one validation call is made for each entity; in this case, reliability is always at 100%. Contact us to find out how reliability varies based on the calls we are making.</Info>
## How to Enable Auto Validation

From the organization page, you can enable or disable self-validation and set the reliability threshold above which entities will be auto-validated.

Auto-validation is divided into entities considered fraudulent and entities considered legitimate, allowing you to enable auto-validation for only one of the two cases and also to set different reliability levels.
<Note>You may consider enabling auto-validation only for legitimate entities, so that human intervention is required only for products considered fraudulent.</Note>
